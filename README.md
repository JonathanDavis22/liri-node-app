# Liri-Node-App

A Siri-style JavaScript/Node application.

## Getting Started

Using Node and your Liri application, search Spotify for a song, Bands In Town for if a musical artist or group is playing in your city
soon, or OMDB for information about any movie you might be curious about.

### Prerequisites

Node, Moment, Axios, Request.

### Installing

Download the repository. Create a .env file with your individual API keys. Open your terminal and run the Liri JavaScript file in Node.

### Use

## Spotify

Use the command "spotify-this-song" and then the song title in quotations in order to search songs. Sometimes including more information, 
such as the band name, helps clean up results.
